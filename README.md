Scraping using the GitHub API 
1. Scraping the data: The data was scraped in Google Colab. I defined separate functions for fetching user and repository data and executed them in loop for all users.
2. Interesting fact from data: Javascript is the programming language that has most number of projects (7770) while Python has relatively less number of projects (4660) despite python's versatility.
3. Recommendation for developers: Get familiarize with sending API requests simultaneously which will save time. Running the command on loop with sleep time to adjust the rate limit was time consuming.
